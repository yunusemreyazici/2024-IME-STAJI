## A modern Data Grid / Spreadsheet component

- This is a complete rewrite of the original [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) in TypeScript with ES6 modules
- Includes many of the extra features and fixes from the [6pac fork](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/)
- Can work without jQuery or jQuery UI (but can use them for column ordering / resizing if available in global namespace)
- Backward compatible with the original via the provided compat files. Just replace SlickGrid scripts with the ones in the [dist/compat](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@serenity-is/sleekgrid?path=dist%2Fcompat) directory.

Please visit [the web site](https://serenity-is.github.io/sleekgrid/) to see the documentation and examples.

SleekGrid is used extensively in [Serenity](https://serenity.is), our [open source](https://github.com/serenity-is/serenity) ASP.NET Core / TypeScript based business application framework. Visit [the demo](https://serenity.is/demo) to see SleekGrid in action!
